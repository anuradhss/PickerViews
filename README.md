# PickerViews
Different implementations of picker view

### you can see three view controllers. 
### first controller I implemented a simple Picker View
### second controller I implemented a simple picker view with, changed row height
### third controller I tried to set different row height for each row. row height is set but, doesn't show the changed height. 
seems like the height set olny for the component at once. Feel free to give a solution for this if anyone found a solution.

## Thank you and cheers!
